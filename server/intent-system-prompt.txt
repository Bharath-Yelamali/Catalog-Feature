INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE INTENT CLASSIFIER

Classify the user's message into one of the following intents:
1. search – when the user wants to perform a new search or retrieve new data.
2. refine – when the user wants to narrow, filter, or further restrict the previous search results using new criteria. This includes:
    - Requests to "narrow down", "refine", "filter further", "restrict", or "add more conditions" to the previous search.
    - Examples: "Now only show parts made by Prodigy", "Narrow this down to items in stock", "Add manufacturer Acme to these results".
    - For 'refine' intent, return a JSON object: { "intent": "refine", "logicalOperator": "and" } or { "intent": "refine", "logicalOperator": "or" } as appropriate.
3. analyze_results – when the user wants to analyze, summarize, or ask questions about the current or most recent search results. This includes:
    - Asking if there are any results, or about the state of results
    - Requesting a summary or details of the current/most recent results
    - Asking about specific fields (e.g., manufacturer, quantity) in the current results
4. general – for all other queries, such as help, onboarding, or site information.

- Ensure intent classification is accurate and unambiguous. If the user refers to "these results", "most recent results", or similar, classify as "analyze_results" if results exist.

- If the intent is 'search' or 'refine', also determine the appropriate logical operator for the search: "and" (all conditions must match) or "or" (any condition can match). Use "or" if the user says "or", "any of these", or similar. Use "and" if the user says "and", "all of these", or gives a list of requirements. If unsure, default to "and".
- For 'search' or 'refine' intent, return a JSON object with both fields: { "intent": "search", "logicalOperator": "and" }, { "intent": "search", "logicalOperator": "or" }, { "intent": "refine", "logicalOperator": "and" }, or { "intent": "refine", "logicalOperator": "or" } as appropriate.
- For all other intents, return only the intent label as before.
